        <p align="center"><abbr title="statue of unity"><img style="box-shadow:0px 15px 15px black;" src="img_34.jpg"
                    width="300px" height="250px"></abbr></p>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">The Statue of Unity is a colossal statue of Indian statesman and independence
            activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, located near the Narmada River in the Kevadia region of Gujarat. As
            of my
            last update, it is the world's tallest statue, standing at a height of 182 meters (597 feet). The statue
            is
            not only a tribute to Patel's contributions but also offers a panoramic view of the surrounding area.
            The
            site also includes a museum and exhibition hall detailing Patel's life and achievements.The Statue of
            Unity
            is the world's tallest statue at 182 metres (597 ft). It rises 54 metres (177 ft) higher than the
            previous
            record holder, the Spring Temple Buddha in China's Henan province.[37] The previous tallest statue in
            India
            was the 41 m (135 ft) tall statue of Lord Hanuman at the Paritala Anjaneya Temple near Vijayawada in the
            state of Andhra Pradesh. The statue can be seen within a 7 km (4.3 mi) radius.[10]

            The monument is constructed on a river island named Sadhu Bet, 3.2 km (2.0 mi) away from and facing the
            Narmada Dam downstream.[1] The statue and its surroundings occupy more than 2 hectares (4.9 acres),[38]
            and
            are surrounded by a 12 km (7.5 mi) long artificial lake formed by the Garudeshwar weir downstream on the
            Narmada river.[39][10]

            The statue is divided into five zones of which only three are accessible to the public. From its base to
            the
            level of Patel's shins is the first zone which has three levels and includes the exhibition area,
            mezzanine
            and roof. The first zone also contains a memorial garden and a museum. The second zone reaches up to
            Patel's
            thighs, while the third extends up to the viewing gallery at a height of 153 metres. The fourth zone is
            the
            maintenance area while the final zone comprises the head and shoulders of the statue.[40][10]</p>
        <p align="center"><abbr title="statue of unity"><img style="box-shadow:0px 15px 15px black;" src="img_37.jpg"
                    width="450px" height="650px"></abbr></p>


        <p style="color: aliceblue;">The museum in the first zone catalogues the life of Sardar Patel and his
            contributions. An adjoining
            audio-visual gallery provides a 15-minute long presentation on Patel and also describes the tribal
            culture
            of the state.[10] The concrete towers which form the statue's legs contain two elevators each. Each lift
            can
            carry 26 people at a time to the viewing gallery in just over 30 seconds. The gallery is located at a
            height
            of 153 metres (502 ft) and can hold up to 200 people.[41][42]</p>

        <p align="center"><abbr title="Kalika Mata Temple-Pavagadh "><img style="box-shadow:0px 15px 15px black;"
                    src="img_38.jpg" width="400px" height="200px"></abbr></p>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">Pavagadh Hill is a prominent hill located near Champaner in eastern Gujarat.
            It is
            home to the Kalika Mata Temple, an important pilgrimage site dedicated to the goddess Kali. The temple
            is
            situated at the top of the hill and can be reached by a strenuous trek or by using a cable car. The hill
            and
            the surrounding area also hold historical significance due to the presence of the Champaner-Pavagadh
            Archaeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which features ruins of ancient structures and
            fortifications.It is said that king Vanraj Chavda established Champaner at the foot of Pavagadh in fond
            memory of his wise minister Champa. Later, the Patai Raval family ruled it and took care of the
            boundary.
            The folk tales say that Mahakali assumed the form of a woman and danced in a Garba during Navaratri. The
            last Patai, Jaisinh watched her with dirty looks. The deity became angry at Jaisinh and cursed him that
            the
            town will fall. The Muslim emperor of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada assaulted Pavagadh and won the hill on the
            boundary in the 15th century.</p>
        <p align="center"><abbr title="pavagadh"><img style="box-shadow:0px 15px 15px black;" src="img_39.jpg"
                    width="400px" height="300px"></abbr></p>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">
            Patai was defeated and killed. Mahmud Begada shifted his capital from Ahmedabad to Champaner for some time
            for reasons of diplomacy. He developed the town by constructing buildings such as the fort of Champaner,
            Uohra mosque, Mandavi, Kirtistambh, the temple of Shalkh, Jama Masjid, Nagina Mosque, and Kevda Mosque. The
            remains of the Palace of Begada are still found near Vad Talav (Banyan Pond) two kilometers (1.25 miles)
            away from Champaner by road.

            The government has granted many concessions and offered subsidies to the new industries coming up in this
            area. As a result of it, Halol and Kalol towns near Pavagadh have turned into virtual industrial estates. A
            film studio at Halol has this added advantage.</p>

        <p style="color:white;">During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Roman temples began to evince Greek influence,
            using the Greek decorative style but placing the altar within the temple and eventually creating entire
            forums, or meeting places, of which the temple was the centre. In Roman temple architecture, the
            columns, in
            their various styles, soon became engaged rather than freestanding, and circular as well as rectangular
            temples were built. Byzantine and Western church architecture developed from these bases in the

            In the East and Middle East, too, temple design expresses the nature of the religion. For example, the
            asceticism and rich symbolism of Jainism is reflected in that religion’s beautifully decorated
            monastery-like structures in India, both above the ground in simple cloisters and below the ground in
            caves.
            Other Indian temple architecture, although it tends to follow the pattern of a simple floor plan with a
            richly decorated facade, differs according to the ritual. Hindu temples, which vary regionally in style,
            usually consist of a towering shrine and a columned hall surrounded by an elaborate wall. Buddhist

            were
            sometimes built as temples, were towering stacks of brightly coloured, wing-roofed stories over a small
            shrine. By contrast, the Shintō temples of Japan are almost huts, so simple and rustic are their design.

        <p style="color:white;">Asiatic Lions: Gir National Park is famous for being the last natural habitat of
            the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica). The park plays a crucial role in the conservation of this
            endangered species.

            Location: Gir National Park is located in the southwestern part of Gujarat, covering areas of the
            Saurashtra peninsula. It spans across approximately 1,412 square kilometers (545 square miles) of
            diverse landscapes.

            Flora and Fauna: Apart from the Asiatic lion, Gir National Park is home to a wide range of wildlife,
            including various species of mammals, reptiles, and birds. Other prominent animals found in the park
            include leopards, striped hyenas, wild boars, chital (spotted deer), sambar deer, nilgai (blue bull),
            chinkara (Indian gazelle), and more.

            Avian Diversity: Gir is home to over 300 species of birds, making it an excellent destination for
            birdwatching. The park offers a habitat for both resident and migratory bird species.

            Habitats: The park consists of various habitats, including dry deciduous forests, grasslands, scrub
            forests, rocky hills, and water bodies. These diverse ecosystems support a rich array of wildlife.

            Conservation: The Asiatic lion population faced a significant decline in the past, and Gir National Park
            was established in 1965 to protect and conserve these lions. Conservation efforts have led to a gradual
            increase in the lion population.

            Tourism: Gir National Park allows visitors to experience wildlife through safari tours. Jeep safaris are
            a popular way to explore the park and observe the wildlife from a safe distance.

            Crocodile Breeding: Gir National Park is also home to the Kamleshwar Dam, which supports a population of
            marsh crocodiles. The dam has been crucial for crocodile breeding programs.

            Human-Wildlife Conflict: The park's proximity to human settlements has led to occasional conflicts
            between local communities and wildlife. Conservation efforts include initiatives to minimize such
            conflicts and promote coexistence.

            Best Time to Visit: The park remains closed during the monsoon season (June to October). The best time
            to visit is typically from December to April, when the weather is pleasant and wildlife sightings are
            more common.</p>

        <p style="color: white;">Rann of Kutch is a massive expanse of cracked earth, inland from the sea, that
            promises to take your breath away. The nothingness for miles is both nerve wracking and stunning with small
            oasis of water bodies and shrub forests doubling up as homes for pink flamingoes and wild asses. Tribal
            hamlets with cylindrical mud bhungas (huts) are the epicenter for Kutchi embroidery, tie and dye,
            leatherwork, pottery, bell metal craft and the famous Rogan painting by the only surviving expert family.
            Approximately 200 km east of the Rann, is the Little Rann of Kutch, which houses the 4953-sq-km Wild Ass
            Sanctuary. It homes the only remaining population of the chestnut-coloured Indian wild ass (khur), as well
            as blue-bulls, blackbuck and chinkara.
            The area was a once a sprawling shallow of the Arabian Sea until a constant geological shift closed off the
            connection with the sea. Over the years, the region eventually became a seasonal marshy salt desert. During
            monsoons, the marsh fills up with water and the wetland extends from the Gulf of Kutch on the west through
            to the Gulf of Cambay on the east. In the summers, the water dries to create a crunchy based bed of white
